* TODO

- more maintained sty files
- modern visualization/data processing/plotting than gnuplot (ideally,
  python lib that supports pdf)
  
  - option: d3.js + chrome headless support to svg/pdf
  - check: python seaborn/bokeh/ggplot/pygal/plotly/geoplotlib/gleam
    (ref. https://blog.modeanalytics.com/python-data-visualization-libraries/)
  - no proper/architecture-neutral pdf support
  - NO matplotlib; its model/code is too ugly

- example in this main repo (as an example and for studying)
- summarize pointers for latex beginner (e.g., explaining common issues)
  - e.g., ~ use 
- summarize dependencies for mac/windows
- better code highlighting (+ ref support)
- spell check on svg
- check draftable for generating diffs (https://draftable.com/)
